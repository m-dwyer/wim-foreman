Intro:

A basic set of scripts for preparing a bootable WinPE environment from a Windows ISO, and provisioning via Foreman. This will allow you to create and provision a Windows machine without the requirement of an existing Windows machine running Windows AIK/ADK for prepping.

Requirements:

wimlib (mkwinpeimg)
Foreman 1.10.1

Usage:

Prepping a bootable WinPE environment:

1. Place a Windows ISO in the iso/ directory
2. Place a copy of the wimboot executable in the root of this directory
3. Place a copy of wget64.exe in the overlay/staging/ directory
4. Run ./prepwinpe.sh iso/$ISOFILE $FOREMANHOST.  This will prepare the needed boot files and scripts to bootstrap a Windows install from the Foreman host
5. Sync the contents of staging/ into a directory on a web server.  This will be used as the Foreman Installation Media

Configuring Foreman:

1. Within Foreman, import the PXELinux, Provision, PESetup and Finish templates in wim-templates/
2. Add new Installation Media, referencing the root directory where files were previously synced to as per Step 5 in the Prepping section
3. Create a new Windows OS, referencing the Installation Media and link to the imported templates.  Ensure the Root Password Hash is set to Base64
4. Create a new host, selecting the newly created Windows OS.  Make sure you specify the wimImageName parameter.  To find this, run wimlib-imagex info staging/sources/install.wim

You should now be able to boot the targeted machine and automatically provision Windows.  The resulting installation will then check in to the Puppet master.
